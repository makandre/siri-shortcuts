This shortcut comprises of a main [Media Downloader](Media%20Downloader.shortcut) shortcut that uses other shortcuts to download video from specific sites. Currently the following sites are supported:

- [YouTube](YouTube%20Downloader.shortcut)
- [Facebook](Facebook%20Downloader.shortcut)

Downloading from other sites (such as Twitter) was broken and may be added back in the future.

After downloading a video, you will have the option to save as audio format.
