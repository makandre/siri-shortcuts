# Media Downloader

This [shortcut](Media%20Downloader.shortcut) is a refactor of the [Media Downloader](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/00d0076176854dc083c2067e30bd543f) that is described at https://blogtip.org/how-to-download-youtube-facebook-videos-on-iphone

The shortcut will now use separate downloader shortcuts to download media from different sites.  The following downloaders are available:

- [YouTube](YouTube%20Downloader.shortcut) (based on steps from the original Media Downloader)
- [Facebook](Facebook%20Downloader.shortcut) (based on steps from the original Media Downloader)
- [Twitter](Twitter%20Downloader.shortcut) (based on this [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e5f06ab2d11c4837adc40944900f6ca8) created by u/freelancedev_ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9o0qxb/twitter_video_downloader_v15/))
- [Other](Content%20Downloader.shortcut) (a catch-all option to download the contents of the input URL directly)

Additionally, with the exception of the Other option, you will be able to save the downloaded file as audio only.

If you want to use the downloaders on their own, you will need to do the following:

1. Re-enable showing the shortcut in the Share Sheet and choose URL as the input type
2. Add a final step to save or share the downloaded file
