# Media Downloader

This [shortcut](Media%20Downloader.shortcut) is a refactor of the [Media Downloader](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/00d0076176854dc083c2067e30bd543f) that is described at https://blogtip.org/how-to-download-youtube-facebook-videos-on-iphone

The shortcut will now use separate downloader shortcuts to download from different sites.  Additionally, after downloading a video, you will have the option to save as audio format.

Downloaders for the following sites are available:

- [YouTube](YouTube%20Downloader.shortcut) (based on steps from the original Media Downloader)
- [Facebook](Facebook%20Downloader.shortcut) (based on steps from the original Media Downloader)
- [Twitter](Twitter%20Downloader.shortcut) (based on this [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e5f06ab2d11c4837adc40944900f6ca8) created by u/freelancedev_ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9o0qxb/twitter_video_downloader_v15/))

If you want to use the downloaders on their own, you will need to do the following:

1. Re-enable showing the shortcut in the Share Sheet and choose URL as the input type
2. Add a final step to save or share the downloaded video file
