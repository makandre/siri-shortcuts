# Miscellaneous Shortcuts

This folder contains some other useful shortcuts which are mostly found in the shortcuts gallery or from other places online.  They are quite small and what each one does is self-explanatory.

There is a separate [meta.json](meta.json) file here that can be used with the [Update Shortcuts](../Update%20Shortcuts) shortcut.
